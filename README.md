# What is Javascript Projects?
JavaScript projects is a small (but growing) repository of projects built to demonstrate core programming skills through clear logic, comments, and documentation. Each project focuses on fundamental JavaScript concepts such as data manipulation, problem solving, and clean code organization. :sweat_smile:

# Why create Javascript Prjects?
1. One goal of this repository is to showcase my understanding of JavaScript by building functional, readable, and well-documented code, rather than focusing on UI or styling.
2. Another goal is to learn github and markdown more efficiently through this process to be job ready 👍

# Projects (so far)
1. Credit-card-checker
2. Data-leaner
