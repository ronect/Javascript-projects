#This repository contains small JavaScript projects built to demonstrate core programming skills through clear logic, comments, and documentation. Each project focuses on fundamental JavaScript concepts such as data manipulation, problem solving, and clean code organization.

The goal of this repository is to showcase my understanding of JavaScript by building functional, readable, and well-documented code, rather than focusing on UI or styling.
